# Work Experience
## OKX, 2024.09 - Now
- Web3 DEX token market backend system, supporting tens of millions of token data with real-time ranking updates.
- Built a tagging subsystem from scratch, storing 2B+ token/address tag data with read/write QPS exceeding 10K.
> Java | PolarDB-X (distributed MySQL) / Redis / Caffeine | MaxCompute (ODPS) / Kafka / Flink
## Airwallex, 2022.12 - 2024.08
- Supported complex cross-border payment logic involving multi-currency, multi-region, multi-channel, and multi-constraint scenarios.
> Kotlin / Java | PostgreSQL | BigQuery / Kafka
## Bytedance, 2019.12 - 2022.12
### Volcano Engine, 2020.07-2022.12
- Designed both product solution and technical solution for customizable feature engineering from scratch (based on SQL+UDF).
- Led a cross-functional engineering team (20+ engineers) untill project completion.
> Golang / Cpp / Python | TF-Serving / Parameter Server (PS) | Kubernetes (K8s) / Yarn | Hive / Spark / Flink / Kafka
### Lark, 2019.12-2020.06
- Built a no-code/low-code platform based on Lark Open Platform from scratch.
> Golang / Nodejs | MySQL / Redis
## Alibaba, 2014.10 - 2019.11
### Cainiao - AI Department, 2016.11-2019.11
- Pioneered an algorithm engineering approach using object-based DSL (Domain Specific Language) to express constraints and objective functions for Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), decoupling business logic from ALNS (Adaptive Large-Scale Neighbor Search) algorithm logic.
- Independently completed prototype validation, including core algorithm logic, typical business scenarios, and DSL compiler/runtime. Led a cross-functional engineering team in building a service system featuring hot-reloading business logic, one-click DSL testing/deployment, and asynchronous solving progress observability.
- Significantly improved business response speed (3 person-months â†’ 30 minutes).
- Broke multiple BKS (Best Known Solutions) world records for standard VRP problems. Parallelized core ALNS operators via CUDA/C++, achieving 100x+ speedup over Java CPU implementation.
> Java / Cpp / CUDA
### Tmall - Navigation Platform Department, 2014.10-2016.10
- As a fresh graduate, independently took charge of the product review backend system and was promoted from P5 to P6 within a year.
- Revamped the review submission process into a questionnaire format, increasing submission rate by ~5%. Aggregated structured review data for navigation, improving BI-reported conversion rates by ~3% in certain categories.
